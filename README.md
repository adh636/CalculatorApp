# CalculatorApp

This was the first android application I built.  It is a calculator app with very basic functions and logic.  I built this just to get a sense of how java and xml work in Android Studio.

Below you will find the path to the most important files in the Calculator app.

# CalculatorApp/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/calcv2/MainActivity.java
This contains the java code and logic for the app.  It sets the behavior for the different buttons and display.

# CalculatorApp/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
This contains the xml code for the UI the user sees upon opening the app.
