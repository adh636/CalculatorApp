# CalculatorApp

This was the first android application I built.  It is a calculator app with very basic functions and logic.  I built this just to get a sense of how java and xml work in Android Studio.  This came at the beginning of my time learning Java as well as Android programming, so if anything I like to think comparing this to either of my other apps will at least show how far I have come in a relatively short time.

Below you will find links to the most important files in the Calculator app.

This contains the java code and logic for the app.  It sets the behavior for the different buttons and display.

This contains the xml code for the UI that is seen when the app is opened.
